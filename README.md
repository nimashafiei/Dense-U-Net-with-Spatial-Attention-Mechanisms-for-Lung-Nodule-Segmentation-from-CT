# Dense-U-Net-with-Spatial-Attention-Mechanisms-for-Lung-Nodule-Segmentation-from-CT

Lung nodule segmentation is a critical step in the early diagnosis and treatment planning of lung cancer. In this study, I propose a Dense U-Net architecture with spatial attention mechanisms for accurate and efficient segmentation of lung nodules from computed tomography (CT) images. The model leverages dense connections and attention mechanisms to improve gradient flow, feature reuse, and adaptive focus on relevant image regions. I evaluated the performance of the proposed architecture using the Lung Image Database Consortium (LIDC) dataset, a large-scale and publicly available dataset consisting of annotated CT images. The Dense U-Net with spatial attention mechanisms demonstrated superior performance compared to the baseline U-Net architecture, with faster convergence during training. These findings suggest that the proposed Dense U-Net architecture with spatial attention mechanisms can enhance the accuracy and efficiency of lung nodule segmentation, paving the way for improved early diagnosis and treatment planning in lung cancer cases.
